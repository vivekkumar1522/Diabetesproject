## 🩺 Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

### 🤖 About the Project

This project demonstrates how machine learning can help predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical data. With the power of Python, data science, and predictive modeling, we aim to build a reliable model that can support early diagnosis.

> 📊 Built using real-world medical data & machine learning techniques.
